# Enterprise K8s White Paper

The title says "Best Practices for Red Hat OpenShift on the VMware SDDC" but the bast practices are applicable for any enterprise Kubernetes and any virtualization technology. 
The paper was released in Nov/2019 but 75% is still applicable as of this commit.
Number #1 hit if one googles "Openshift best practice vsphere".
